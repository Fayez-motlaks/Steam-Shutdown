# Thank you for your interest in helping to improve Steam Shutdown!

There are very few limitations in the types of pull requests I accept. 
I will not accept a pull request that I believe to change more than necessary, such as:
* A PR that rewrites the entire program from scratch
* A PR that rewrites an entire file just to fix one issue

Aside from that, I review pull requests on a case by case basis, so please review and abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/benjibobs/Steam-Shutdown/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
